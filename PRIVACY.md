# Privacy Policy

## Overview
ChatGPT Thread Saver runs entirely in your browser to export your chat threads as Markdown files. The extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.

## Data handling
- The extension only processes page content on ChatGPT and Gemini when you click the save button.
- The processed content is converted to a Markdown file that is downloaded directly to your device.
- No data is sent to the developer or any third parties.

## Permissions used
- `activeTab` and `scripting`: injects the content script into the current chat tab when you use the extension.
- `host_permissions` for `chatgpt.com`, `chat.openai.com`, and `gemini.google.com`: required so the script can read the chat content to generate your download.

## Storage and retention
The extension does not maintain a database or cloud storage. Generated Markdown files are saved locally by the browser download flow; you can delete them at any time.

## Third parties
No analytics, ads, or trackers are included.
